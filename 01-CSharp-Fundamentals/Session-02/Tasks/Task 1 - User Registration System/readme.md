# Task 1: User Registration System

## Objective
Create a simple registration system with basic validation.

## Requirements
Ask the user to enter:
- Full Name
- Age
- Email Address

## Instructions

1. **Store Inputs**
   - Use suitable data types for each value.

2. **Validation**
   - If age is less than 18 → "Access denied. You must be at least 18."
   - If email does NOT contain "@" → "Invalid email address."

3. **Final Output**
   - If all inputs are valid:
     ```
     Welcome [Name]! Your age ([Age]) is successfully saved.
     ```

**Note:** No need to repeat input if it’s wrong (loops not yet studied).
